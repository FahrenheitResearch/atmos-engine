    "description": "The Carr Fire ignited on July 23, 2018, when a flat tire on a travel trailer caused sparks along SR 299 near Whiskeytown National Recreation Area. Fueled by extreme heat (110+ F), low humidity, and terrain-channeled winds through the Sacramento River Canyon, the fire grew rapidly westward toward Redding. Three days later, on July 26, the fire generated an EF3-equivalent fire tornado with winds exceeding 143 mph that killed 4 people and caused catastrophic structural damage.",
    "meteorological_setup": "A strong upper-level ridge over the interior West produced extreme heat across NorCal with temperatures exceeding 110 F in the Sacramento Valley. The Sacramento River Canyon acted as a natural venturi, channeling and accelerating northwesterly winds into the Redding area. Afternoon upslope/upvalley flow combined with critically low fuel moisture (2-4% in 1-hr fuels) created explosive fire conditions.",

A powerful easterly windstorm driven by an anomalous upper-level ridge and southward-plunging trough produced unprecedented September east wind gusts across Oregon, igniting and explosively spreading multiple fires. Within 24-36 hours, five simultaneous megafires (>100,000 acres each) erupted across western Oregon, burning nearly as much forest west of the Cascades in two weeks (~340,000 hectares) as in the previous five decades.",

This drove historically strong easterly/northeasterly gap and downslope winds through Cascade passes and river valleys. Portland International Airport recorded a 52 mph easterly gust, the strongest September easterly on record. 925mb winds at Salem were unprecedented for the August-September period.",

A mountain wave produced sustained winds of 50-60 mph with gusts of 100-115 mph that maintained intensity for nearly 11 hours. The fire destroyed 1,084 structures in Louisville, Superior, and unincorporated Boulder County, causing over $2 billion in insured losses.

    "meteorological_setup": "An intense mountain wave developed as very strong westerly jet-level winds raced over the Front Range and crashed down onto the adjacent plains. The southward migration of the large-scale jet axis across Boulder County triggered a transition into enhanced upper-level descent, amplifying the downstream mountain wave. The highest gust of 115 mph was recorded by an APRS station. Multiple locations along the foothills recorded 100+ mph. The complete absence of snowfall that season (unprecedented drought since July) left fine fuels critically dry despite it being late December.",

With 12z init, the entire critical period falls in the F4-F10 range -- ideal for HRRR mesoscale accuracy. The mountain wave dynamics that drove the windstorm are best resolved at shorter lead times where the model can more accurately capture the wave amplitude and surface wind coupling. The 12z cycle also benefits from a full morning radiosonde/surface obs data assimilation cycle. Winds continued to ~02:00 UTC Dec 31 (F14 from 12z), well within even F18 non-synoptic range, though 12z is synoptic with F48."

    "meteorological_setup": "An extremely strong high-pressure system over the Great Basin created one of the most intense Santa Ana wind events in decades. A steep northerly pressure gradient drove winds exceeding 100 mph through mountain passes and canyons. The winds were channeled and accelerated through the San Gabriel and Santa Monica Mountains. Southern California had experienced its driest 9-month period on record, with live fuel moisture in chamise, sage, and ceanothus at critically low levels. Back-to-back wet winters had produced abundant vegetation that subsequently cured to explosive conditions.",

Wind gusts reached 70 mph at the fire front. The fire's evening ignition coincided with intensifying winds during the nocturnal phase of the Santa Ana event, when downslope flow strengthens.

    "description": "The Gifford Fire was first reported at 3:44 PM on August 1, 2025, near the Gifford Trailhead along Highway 166 in the Los Padres National Forest, northeast of Santa Maria. The fire exploded to 800 acres within 15 minutes of ignition, driven by extreme heat (~95 F), very low relative humidity, and strong winds through the same terrain corridor that fueled the Madre Fire weeks earlier. It ultimately burned 131,614 acres across San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties, surpassing the Madre Fire as the largest California wildfire of 2025 and achieving mega-fire status.",
    "meteorological_setup": "A strong thermal ridge maintained temperatures around 95 F with very low relative humidity across the Central Coast interior. Persistent drought had kept fuel moisture critically low, with abundant grass loads fully cured. Coastal marine layer suppression allowed hot, dry interior air to dominate the fire area. Canyon-channeled winds along the Highway 166 corridor and through the Sierra Madre Mountains amplified fire spread. The same terrain and weather pattern that drove the Madre Fire a month earlier created similarly explosive conditions.",

Helene was the strongest hurricane on record in the Big Bend and the deadliest US mainland hurricane since Katrina. While the 15-foot storm surge devastated coastal Taylor and Dixie counties, Helene's most catastrophic impacts occurred far inland: the storm carried enormous moisture northward into the southern Appalachians, producing 20-30 inches of rain that caused historic, civilization-altering flooding in western North Carolina. At least 250 people were killed across six states.",
    "meteorological_setup": "Helene tracked rapidly north-northeast from the eastern Gulf, embedded in strong southerly flow ahead of a deep mid-latitude trough. The storm's unusually fast forward speed (~25 mph) and large circulation efficiently transported tropical moisture far inland. As this moisture impinged on the southern Appalachians (elevations 3000-6000 ft), extreme orographic enhancement produced rainfall rates exceeding 3 in/hr. Already-saturated soils from earlier rains led to catastrophic landslides and river flooding from the French Broad to the Swannanoa to the Nolichucky river basins.",

Milton had previously undergone the most extreme rapid intensification ever recorded in the Gulf of Mexico â€” jumping from tropical depression to Category 5 (180 mph) in just 48 hours on October 7, with an 84 mb pressure drop and 90 mph wind increase in 24 hours. Though Milton weakened before landfall, it still produced devastating storm surge (up to 10 feet south of Tampa Bay), spawned a historic tornado outbreak (46+ tornadoes), and caused $34 billion in damage.",
    "meteorological_setup": "Milton formed in the western Gulf and rapidly intensified over extremely warm SSTs made 400-800x more probable by climate change according to Climate Central analysis. A strong upper-level anticyclone provided exceptionally low shear during intensification. An approaching mid-latitude trough increased shear before landfall, weakening Milton from Cat 5 to Cat 3, while also accelerating the storm eastward across the Florida peninsula. The trough-storm interaction also enhanced the tornado outbreak through increased low-level shear on the storm's leading edge.",

F00-F05 show the Gulf approach, F06-F12 capture the unprecedented tornado outbreak ahead of the storm (the most tornadoes ever from a landfalling hurricane), and F13 is the Cat 3 landfall at Siesta Key.

An EF3 tornado with 160-165 mph winds struck Sulphur (pop. 4,951) in Murray County at 10:25 PM CDT, carving a 7.5-mile path and devastating the downtown area. Later, an EF4 tornado with 170 mph winds tracked 27 miles through Marietta in Love County at 11:08 PM CDT, reaching 900 yards wide. The Marietta tornado was Oklahoma's first violent tornado in 8 years. Two fatalities occurred between the two tornadoes.",

The tornado struck Valley View with 135 mph winds, devastating a truck stop on Interstate 35 where dozens were trapped, a mobile home community (FRF Estates), and areas around Lake Ray Roberts. Most fatalities occurred at the manufactured home park. The nocturnal timing and crossing of a major interstate made this event particularly deadly.",

The warm sector featured record 75F temperatures at multiple Iowa locations, fueling embedded tornadoes in a season normally dominated by snow.",
    "meteorological_setup": "A rapidly deepening surface low over the Northern High Plains created an extreme pressure gradient that generated fierce winds. Unseasonably warm temperatures (record 75F in Iowa) created a destabilized warm sector far north of typical December positions. The tight gradient drove a 60-80 mph forward-moving squall line that maintained convective integrity for 800+ miles, making it the longest-tracked December derecho on record.",

This was the onset phase of the Omega Block pattern, with 500mb geopotential heights reaching record values over British Columbia and Washington. This HRRR cycle captures the buildup of the ridge and the development of extreme subsidence warming on June 28, the day Portland and Salem set all-time records (Salem 117F).",

The blocking high featured extreme subsidence warming (omega strongly negative/sinking), inhibiting cloud formation and maximizing insolation. Diabatic heating through sensible heat fluxes from dry soils amplified temperatures beyond what dynamical warming alone could produce. The ridge was preceded by an offshore trough that helped amplify the downstream ridge through Rossby wave dynamics. Tropical moisture contributed to the initial ridge amplification.",

    "description": "On July 4, 2025, a mesoscale convective vortex (MCV) formed from pre-existing thunderstorm complexes and interacted with remnant moisture from ex-Tropical Storm Barry to produce catastrophic flash flooding in the Texas Hill Country. The Guadalupe River at Hunt rose 26 feet in 45 minutes before the gauge failed at 29 feet, ultimately cresting at 37.52 feet. At least 135 people were killed (117 in Kerr County), including 27 campers and staff at Camp Mystic. Rainfall totals exceeded 10-12 inches in 6 hours, with a measured maximum of 20.33 inches.",
    "meteorological_setup": "Remnant tropical moisture from ex-Tropical Storm Barry, which had made landfall in Mexico days earlier, provided a deep tropical moisture plume (PWATs 2.0-2.5 inches) over central Texas. A mesoscale convective vortex developed from overnight thunderstorm complexes, creating a mid-level circulation that focused extreme ascent and precipitation training over the Guadalupe River headwaters in Kerr County. The MCV essentially spun the tropical moisture, producing persistent heavy rain of 2-4 inches per hour over steep Hill Country terrain where rapid runoff into narrow river channels caused flash flooding with minimal warning time.",

The 00z init captures the full MCV lifecycle: convective initiation and vortex spin-up (F0-F5), peak rainfall training over the Guadalupe River headwaters (F6-F10), and the catastrophic 26-foot river rise at Hunt (F9-F10). The MCV genesis from pre-existing storms at F0 is critical context -- moving to a later init (e.g., 03z) would miss the initial circulation development. The 00z synoptic cycle also benefits from evening radiosonde observations that capture the tropical moisture plume from ex-Barry (PWAT 2.0-2.5 inches)."
