\begin{abstract}
The 2018 Camp Fire destroyed the town of Paradise, California, in fewer than four hours on 8 November 2018, killing 85 people and burning 18,804 structures---the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history. This study reconstructs the three-dimensional atmospheric environment of the Camp Fire using vertical cross-sections extracted from the HRRR (High-Resolution Rapid Refresh) 3-km model via the wxsection.com cross-section data API. Analysis of 44 cross-sections spanning 19 visualization products across multiple transects and forecast hours reveals an atmospheric environment of compound extremity: (1) a low-level easterly jet of 35--39~kt at 875--900~hPa channeled through the Feather River Canyon with near-perfect downslope alignment; (2) relative humidity of 5--13\% through the entire troposphere below 600~hPa, with no diurnal recovery over 24~hours; (3) persistent subsidence exceeding 6~hPa~hr$^{-1}$ over the Sierra crest, adiabatically warming and desiccating the descending air; (4) vapor pressure deficit of 13--20~hPa, representing 2--3$\times$ the extreme fire danger threshold; (5) zero cloud condensate at every level and location along the fire path; and (6) a subsidence inversion that concentrated wind energy at the surface and forced lateral rather than vertical fire spread. These conditions exceeded standard red flag warning criteria by factors of 1.3--3.3$\times$ across all parameters simultaneously. The atmosphere on 8 November 2018 functioned as a combustion optimization engine, maximizing every variable that promotes wildfire ignition, spread, and intensity while minimizing every variable that could inhibit them.
