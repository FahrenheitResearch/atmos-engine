# Terrain, Fuel & Ignition Analysis: Western Oklahoma Prescribed Burns
## February 9, 2026 | Red Flag Warning Event

**Analyst Role**: Terrain, Fuel & Ignition Analyst
**Assessment Date**: 2026-02-10
**Sites**: Woodward OK (36.43, -99.39), Gage OK (36.31, -99.76), Elk City OK (35.41, -99.40)

---

## Executive Summary

Western Oklahoma's terrain is **gently rolling grassland** with no canyons, no steep segments, and minimal topographic barriers. All three sites classify as `rolling_hills` with maximum slopes of 3-6 degrees and average slopes under 1 degree. This terrain is among the most predictable landscapes in the United States for fire behavior modeling -- fire spread is overwhelmingly governed by wind speed and fuel moisture, not topography. However, this same flatness means **there are virtually no natural firebreaks** to arrest a fire that escapes control lines.

Fuel conditions on February 9 were at or near the worst possible state: **critically low fuel moisture (2-5% at Gage and Elk City, 5-8% at Woodward)**, zero precipitation for 8+ days, temperatures 29-31 degrees F above normal, and relative humidity dropping to 10.2% at Gage. These are conditions where any ignition source -- a spark from equipment, a power line arc, an ember lofted 100 yards -- will instantly establish fire in the continuous dormant grass fuel bed.

**Bottom line**: The terrain supports the argument that prescribed burns *can* be conducted safely here (flat = predictable), but the fuel moisture and weather conditions on February 9, 2026 categorically did not support safe burning. The very urgency created by drought and fuel accumulation is precisely what made the conditions too dangerous to act on that specific day.

## 1. Terrain Complexity Analysis

### 1.1 Site-by-Site Terrain Classification

| Metric | Woodward | Gage | Elk City |
|--------|----------|------|----------|
| **Terrain Class** | Rolling Hills | Rolling Hills | Rolling Hills |
| **Center Elevation** | 1,942 ft | 2,172 ft | 1,929 ft |
| **Total Relief (15km radius)** | 502 ft | 390 ft | 512 ft |
| **Most Complex Direction** | SW (413 ft relief) | N (302 ft relief) | SE (1 valley, 180 ft) |
| **Max Slope** | 3.6 deg (W) | 3.2 deg (SE) | 5.0 deg (NW) |
| **Avg Slope (all dirs)** | 0.7 deg | 0.7 deg | 0.7 deg |
| **Canyon Features** | None | None | None |
| **Steep Segments** | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **Valley/Draw Count** | 0 | 0 (within 15km) | 1 shallow (SE) |

**Key finding**: All three sites have **zero canyon features and zero steep segments**. The single valley detected at Elk City SE is a broad, shallow draw (98 ft depth over 6.4 km width, maximum slopes 1.7 degrees) -- functionally flat terrain with a gentle swale.

### 1.2 Woodward City Assessment -- Quadrant Analysis

| Quadrant | Terrain | Fire Difficulty |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| N, NE, E, SE, NW | Gently rolling | **Low** |
| S | Moderate relief (302 ft) | **Moderate** |
| SW | Moderate relief (423 ft) | **Moderate** |
| W | Moderate relief (318 ft) | **Moderate** |

**Worst-case scenario**: "Wind-driven grassfire with continuous fuels and limited barriers. Rate of spread determined primarily by wind speed and fuel moisture."

The moderate-difficulty quadrants (S, SW, W) correspond to gently rising terrain toward the High Plains escarpment, not to any cliff, canyon, or steep slope. Even the "most complex" direction (SW at 423 ft relief) has an average slope of only 0.7 degrees.

### 1.3 Gage City Assessment -- Quadrant Analysis

| Quadrant | Terrain | Fire Difficulty |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| NE, SW, W | Gently rolling | **Low** |
| E | 1 valley/draw feature | **Low** |
| N | 1 valley/draw, 302 ft relief | **Moderate** |
| SE | 341 ft relief | **Moderate** |
| S | 305 ft relief | **Moderate** |
| NW | 315 ft relief | **Moderate** |

Gage sits higher on the High Plains (2,172 ft) than Woodward. The N quadrant contains a shallow valley (112 ft depth over 7.8 km width) -- a broad, gentle draw typical of the Canadian River drainage. No terrain features that would create unpredictable fire behavior.

### 1.4 Natural Firebreaks Assessment

**Verdict: Essentially none.**

- No canyons, cliffs, or rocky escarpments at any site
- No significant water bodies within 15 km radius of any site
- The Canadian River (N of Woodward) and Washita River (near Elk City) provide *minor* seasonal barriers, but in February drought conditions these are typically low-flow or dry
- Highway corridors (US-270 near Woodward, US-283 near Gage, I-40 near Elk City) provide narrow fuel breaks but are insufficient to stop wind-driven grass fires
- **The absence of natural firebreaks means prescribed burn containment depends entirely on constructed fire lines and suppression resources**

## 2. Elevation Profile Analysis

### 2.1 East-West Transect (35.5N, from -99.5 to -95.0)

This 407-km (253-mile) transect crosses Oklahoma from the western grasslands near Elk City to eastern Oklahoma.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **West end** | 2,005 ft (611 m) |
| **East end** | 650 ft (198 m) |
| **Total drop** | 1,355 ft over 253 miles |
| **Average grade** | 0.10% (essentially flat) |
| **Max local grade** | 0.88% |
| **Max elevation** | 2,054 ft |
| **Min elevation** | 463 ft |
| **Total relief** | 1,591 ft |

**Western Oklahoma focus** (-99.5 to -98.7, first 83 km):
- Relief: 554 ft over 83 km
- This is the burn zone -- a gradual slope from 2,054 ft to 1,499 ft
- Average grade: ~0.2% -- a billiard table tilted slightly east

### 2.2 North-South Transect (37.0 to 34.5, along -99.0W)

This 278-km (173-mile) transect runs through western Oklahoma from the Kansas border to near the Red River.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **North end** | 1,844 ft (562 m) |
| **South end** | 1,273 ft (388 m) |
| **Total drop** | 571 ft over 173 miles |
| **Average grade** | 0.06% (flatter than E-W) |
| **Max local grade** | 0.90% |
| **Total relief** | 673 ft |

**Woodward latitude band** (36.4-36.5N): Relief of only **59 ft** over ~11 km -- extraordinarily flat.

**Elk City latitude band** (35.4-35.5N): Relief of **121 ft** over ~17 km -- still very flat with gentle undulations.

### 2.3 Terrain Summary for Fire Behavior

Western Oklahoma is one of the flattest landscapes in North America where grass fires regularly occur. Grades under 1% mean:
- **Topographic fire acceleration is negligible** -- no upslope runs, no chimney effects
- **Wind is the dominant spread vector** -- fire behavior models (BehavePlus, FARSITE) can assume flat ground
- **Mechanized suppression is highly feasible** -- engines, dozers, and plows can operate anywhere
- **BUT: wind-driven fire spread is completely unimpeded** -- there is nothing to slow or redirect a grass fire except the wind itself and constructed barriers

## 3. Fuel Conditions Assessment

### 3.1 Fuel Type

All three sites: **Dormant prairie grass** (blue grama, buffalo grass, sideoats grama) -- NFDRS Fuel Model A / FBPS Fuel Model 1 (Short Grass).

The seasonal fuel context is critical: **"Freeze-dried dormant grass -- repeated freeze-thaw cycles break down cell structure making fuels extremely receptive to ignition. Unlike summer-cured grass, winter fuels have been through months of freezing that ruptures plant cells, creating a porous structure that dries faster and ignites more easily."**

### 3.2 Fuel Moisture Estimates

| Station | Fuel Moisture | Category | Critical? |
|---------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| **Woodward (KWDG)** | 5-8% | Very Low | Yes -- below 8% threshold |
| **Gage (KGAG)** | 2-5% | **Critically Low** | **Extreme** |
| **Elk City (KELK)** | 2-5% | **Critically Low** | **Extreme** |

**Context**: The 8% dead fuel moisture threshold marks the onset of extreme fire behavior in grass fuels. Gage and Elk City were at **2-5%** -- half or less of the extreme threshold. At these moisture levels:
- Any spark source ignites fuels instantly
- Rate of spread: 2-4 mph typical, **6+ mph in worst conditions**
- Spot fires establish rapidly from any ember or burning debris
- Short flame lengths (3-8 ft) but extremely fast spread creates entrapment risk

### 3.3 Recent Weather Impact on Fuels

**7-Day Weather Summary (Feb 3-9, 2026)**:

| Metric | Woodward | Gage | Elk City |
|--------|----------|------|----------|
| Days above 60F | 5/7 | 6/7 | **7/7** |
| Days above 70F | 3/7 | 2/7 | **5/7** |
| Max temp | 78.8F | **80.0F** | 79.0F |
| Temp anomaly | +28.8F | **+31.0F** | N/A |
| 7-day precip | 0.02 in (trace) | **0.00 in** | **0.00 in** |
| Days since precip | 6 | **8+** | **8+** |
| Min RH | 22.6% | **10.2%** | 16.0% |
| Avg daytime RH | 49.5% | **31.4%** | 34.4% |
| Avg dewpoint | 36.1F | 29.0F | 32.8F |
| Fuel trend | DETERIORATING | **DETERIORATING** | MIXED |

**February 9 specifically** (the burn day):

| Metric | Woodward | Gage | Elk City |
|--------|----------|------|----------|
| High temp | **78.8F** | **80.0F** | **79.0F** |
| Min RH | 22.6% | **10.2%** | 16.0% |
| Max wind | 18 kt | **27 kt** | 20 kt |
| Max gust | 25 kt | **34 kt** | 23 kt |

**Gage on February 9 recorded 10.2% relative humidity** -- a value that approaches the theoretical minimum for the region and represents conditions where fuels simply cannot retain moisture. Combined with gusts to 34 knots (39 mph), this was an extreme fire weather day by any standard.

### 3.4 Seasonal Context

February is the **primary prescribed burn window** for Oklahoma grasslands:
- Fuels are 100% dormant and cured (no green-up until April-May)
- This is biologically the correct time to burn -- cool-season grasses benefit from dormant-season fire
- Oklahoma Forestry Division and NRCS recommend January-March burns for rangeland management
- **However, the burn window requires weather cooperation** -- not every day in February is a safe burn day

### 3.5 Critical Threshold Exceedances on February 9

| Threshold | Value | Exceeded? |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 3+ days above 60F after freeze | 5-7 days above 60F | **YES -- EXCEEDED** |
| Any day above 70F in winter | 78-80F recorded | **YES -- FAR EXCEEDED** |
| 7+ days without precip | 6-8+ days | **YES -- EXCEEDED** |
| Daytime RH <15% | 10.2% at Gage | **YES -- EXCEEDED** |
| Dewpoints <20F | 28-36F (not met) | No |

Four of five critical thresholds were exceeded. The fuel conditions assessment algorithm rated all three sites as producing conditions where **"fire spread will be difficult to contain with initial attack resources."**

## 4. Ignition Risk Assessment

### 4.1 Ignition Sources

| Source | Woodward | Gage | Elk City |
|--------|----------|------|----------|
| Power lines | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate |
| Highway traffic | Low | Low | **Moderate** |
| Agricultural equipment | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate |
| Prescribed burns | **ACTIVE** | **ACTIVE** | -- |

These are rural, agricultural communities. The baseline ignition risk is moderate from power lines and farm equipment -- standard for the Southern Plains. Elk City has elevated highway ignition risk due to I-40 passing 5 km from the site.

### 4.2 Highway and Transportation Corridors

- **Elk City**: I-40 runs 5.4 km south -- "Moderate ignition risk from vehicle-related sources. Fires starting along highways spread into adjacent grassland."
- **Woodward**: US-270 and US-412 intersect at Woodward; no interstate but significant highway traffic
- **Gage**: US-283 runs through town; lower traffic volume but still a potential ignition corridor

### 4.3 Prescribed Burn as Intentional Ignition

On February 9, the dominant ignition source was **deliberate**: prescribed burns being conducted during Red Flag Warning conditions. In the context of this investigation, the ignition risk assessment is inverted -- the question is not "what might start a fire?" but rather "given that fire was deliberately introduced, could it be contained?"

With fuel moisture at 2-5%, any fire introduced into the landscape -- whether by prescribed burn, equipment spark, or lightning -- would spread rapidly. The intentional introduction of fire under these conditions requires extraordinary confidence in containment.

---

## 5. Drought Status

### 5.1 Available Evidence

The US Drought Monitor API was unavailable at assessment time. However, the observed weather data provides overwhelming indirect evidence of significant drought:

- **Zero measurable precipitation** at Gage and Elk City for 8+ consecutive days
- **Only trace precipitation** (0.02 inches) at Woodward over 7 days
- **Temperatures 29-31F above February normals** for sustained periods
- **Relative humidity reaching 10.2%** at Gage -- a value that only occurs during significant drought episodes
- **Average daytime RH of 31%** at Gage -- well below the 40% threshold that normally provides some fire behavior moderation

### 5.2 Drought Implications for Prescribed Burning

The drought creates a paradox:

**Arguments that drought increases urgency to burn (PRO):**
- Fuel accumulation from prior growing seasons has not been reduced by natural fire
- Continuous fuel beds create landscape-scale wildfire risk if ignited accidentally
- Prescribed burning reduces fuel loads before the dangerous spring fire season (March-April)
- Without burning, an accidental ignition could produce an uncontrolled wildfire of greater consequence

**Arguments that drought makes burning more dangerous (CON):**
- Fuel moisture at 2-5% means fire behavior will be extreme regardless of terrain
- Rate of spread in drought-cured grass: 6+ mph in worst conditions -- faster than humans can run
- Spot fire distance increases dramatically in dry conditions
- Fire lines may be inadequate when fuels are this dry and winds are this strong
- **The drought that creates the urgency to burn is the same drought that makes burning most dangerous**

## 6. Integrated Terrain-Fuel-Weather Assessment

### 6.1 Factors Supporting Prescribed Burns (PRO)

| Factor | Evidence | Weight |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **Flat terrain = predictable behavior** | All sites "rolling hills," avg slopes <1 deg, no canyons | **Strong** |
| **Mechanized access** | Engines and dozers can operate in all quadrants; all assessed as "accessible for suppression" | **Strong** |
| **Correct burn season** | February is within the Jan-Mar prescribed burn window for OK grasslands | **Strong** |
| **Fuel reduction urgency** | Continuous dormant grass fuel beds + drought = high wildfire risk if not managed | **Moderate** |
| **No topographic fire acceleration** | Max slopes 3-6 degrees; no chimney effects or canyon channeling | **Strong** |
| **Modelable fire behavior** | FBPS Model 1 on flat ground -- simplest possible fire behavior calculation | **Strong** |

### 6.2 Factors Against Prescribed Burns on This Day (CON)

| Factor | Evidence | Weight |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **No natural firebreaks** | Zero canyons, no significant water bodies, no rocky barriers | **Critical** |
| **Critically low fuel moisture** | 2-5% at Gage/Elk City, 5-8% at Woodward; extreme fire behavior threshold | **Critical** |
| **8+ days without rain** | Gage and Elk City had zero precip for 8+ days | **Critical** |
| **Extreme temperature anomaly** | 29-31F above February normals; 80F at Gage | **Significant** |
| **RH at 10.2% (Gage)** | Near instrument-level dryness; fuels cannot retain moisture | **Critical** |
| **Red Flag Warning in effect** | NWS had explicitly warned against outdoor burning | **Critical** |
| **Gusts to 34 kt (39 mph) at Gage** | Wind-driven fire spread in flat terrain is uncontainable at these speeds | **Critical** |
| **Continuous fuel beds** | CRP grasslands and rangeland = miles of unbroken fuel | **Significant** |
| **Freeze-dried grass more flammable** | Winter fuels ignite more easily than summer-cured grass | **Significant** |
| **Flat terrain = no barriers** | The same flatness that makes fire predictable also means nothing stops it | **Critical** |

### 6.3 The Terrain Paradox

Western Oklahoma's terrain is simultaneously the **best argument for** and the **best argument against** prescribed burning on this day:

- **FOR**: Fire behavior in flat grassland is the most predictable, most modelable fire environment that exists. A prescribed burn manager can calculate rate of spread, flame length, and spotting distance with high confidence. The terrain allows full mechanized suppression access.

- **AGAINST**: In flat grassland with no natural barriers, a fire that exceeds the capacity of suppression resources has **nothing to stop it**. There are no rivers to check its advance, no ridgelines to create wind shadows, no rocky outcrops to interrupt fuel continuity. Once a prescribed burn escapes containment, it becomes a wildfire that will burn until it encounters a highway, a plowed field, or a change in weather.

**On February 9, 2026, the fuel and weather conditions shifted the balance decisively toward CON.** The terrain's predictability is only useful if the predicted fire behavior is within the capacity of available suppression resources. When fuel moisture is 2-5%, RH is 10%, winds are gusting to 39 mph, and there are no natural barriers, the predicted behavior is: **uncontainable spread**.

### 6.4 The Seasonal Urgency Paradox

The seasonal argument deserves careful examination:

- February IS the correct biological season for prescribed burning in Oklahoma grasslands
- Drought-accumulated fuels DO increase wildfire risk and justify fuel management
- **But the burn window is a season, not a single day**
- Every day in February is not a safe burn day, and the existence of a seasonal window does not authorize burning on any particular day within it
- The fact that fuels are dangerously dry creates urgency to burn -- but it also means the burn itself is more dangerous
- **A prescribed burn that escapes containment does not reduce wildfire risk -- it IS the wildfire**

---

## 7. Conclusions

### 7.1 Terrain Assessment
Western Oklahoma is flat grassland with rolling hills, no canyons, no steep terrain, and no natural firebreaks. Terrain complexity is **low** at all three sites. Fire behavior is wind-dominated and highly predictable. This terrain is broadly suitable for prescribed burning under appropriate weather conditions.

### 7.2 Fuel Conditions Assessment
Fuel moisture was **critically low (2-5%)** at Gage and Elk City and **very low (5-8%)** at Woodward on February 9. Fuels had been desiccated by 8+ days without precipitation, temperatures 29-31F above normal, and RH dropping to 10.2%. These are the driest fuel conditions that can be measured in this fuel type. The fuel conditions assessment rates all three sites as producing fire behavior that **"will be difficult to contain with initial attack resources."**

### 7.3 Prescribed Burn Justification
The terrain and seasonal timing support prescribed burning in western Oklahoma in February as a general practice. However, **the specific conditions on February 9, 2026 -- critically low fuel moisture, extreme temperature anomalies, single-digit relative humidity, gale-force gusts, and an active Red Flag Warning -- represented the most dangerous possible conditions within an otherwise valid burn season.** The absence of natural firebreaks in this terrain means that any loss of control would result in unimpeded fire spread across the landscape.

The physical landscape supports prescribed burning as a management tool for this region. The physical landscape does not support prescribed burning on this particular day.
