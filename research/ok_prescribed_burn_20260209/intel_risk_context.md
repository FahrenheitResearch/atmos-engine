## 1. E-W Transect Risk Evolution (35.5N, 99.5W to 95.0W)

The E-W transect spans western Oklahoma through the OKC metro to the eastern border.
Cycle: 20260209_18z (noon CST). Times are local CST.

| FHR | Time (CST) | Risk Score | Risk Level | RH min | RH mean | Wind max (kt) | Temp range (C) | Contributing Factors |
|-----|-----------|------------|------------|--------|---------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|
| F01 | 1:00 PM | 14 | LOW | 21.7% | 30.3% | 2.8 | 19.4-23.6 | Extreme VPD (20.7 hPa) |
| F03 | 3:00 PM | **40** | **MODERATE** | **12.9%** | 22.9% | 4.5 | 21.4-25.4 | **Red Flag RH (min 12.9%)**, Extreme VPD (26.1 hPa) |
| F05 | 5:00 PM | 17 | LOW | 17.0% | 22.8% | 4.4 | 22.6-25.4 | Low mean RH (22.8%), Extreme VPD (25.4 hPa) |
| F08 | 8:00 PM | 13 | LOW | 16.7% | 34.3% | 5.5 | 19.6-22.4 | Extreme VPD (20.8 hPa) |

**Key findings:**
- Risk peaks sharply at F03 (3 PM CST) with a MODERATE score of 40/100
- At F01 (1 PM), risk is LOW (14/100) — conditions not yet at peak
- By F05 (5 PM), risk already declining back to LOW (17/100)
- By F08 (8 PM), RH recovering (mean 34.3%) but note min still 16.7% in western portion
- The 8.9% of the transect below 15% RH at F03 is concentrated in the western half
- **DATA QUALITY WARNING**: Wind values from cross-section transects are column-averaged and appear diluted. Surface winds were much stronger than the 2-5 kt values shown here. NWS reported surface gusts to 35 mph (30 kt). The risk scores above are likely **understated**.

## 2. N-S Transect at Peak (37.0N to 34.5N along 99.0W) — F03

| Metric | N-S Transect (F03) | E-W Transect (F03) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Risk Score | 36 | 40 |
| Risk Level | MODERATE | MODERATE |
| RH min | 13.8% | 12.9% |
| RH mean | **18.6%** | 22.9% |
| Wind max (kt) | 5.0 | 4.5 |
| Temp range (C) | 22.6-25.6 | 21.4-25.4 |
| % below 15% RH | 9.8% | 8.9% |

**Key findings:**
- The N-S transect shows a **lower mean RH (18.6% vs 22.9%)** because it stays entirely within western Oklahoma rather than averaging in the moister eastern half of the state
- Both transects reach MODERATE at peak
- The N-S transect better represents conditions in the prescribed burn zone since it doesn't dilute with eastern OK moisture
- The 18.6% mean RH along the N-S transect, combined with the 13.8% minimum, shows the entire western OK corridor was well below comfortable thresholds

## 3. National Context — Regional Risk Comparison at F03 (3 PM CST Peak)

| Region | Risk Score | Risk Level | RH min | RH mean | Wind max (kt) | Key Factor |
|--------|------------|------------|--------|---------|---------------|------------|
| **NE New Mexico** | **70** | **ELEVATED** | **6.4%** | **10.0%** | 14.1 | Critically low RH, large T spread |
| SE Wyoming | 58 | ELEVATED | 11.1% | 17.2% | 16.8 | Red Flag RH, extreme VPD |
| OK Panhandle | 56 | ELEVATED | 7.0% | 9.4% | 8.1 | Critically low RH (<8%) |
| TX Panhandle | 52 | ELEVATED | 9.4% | 10.9% | 12.2 | Red Flag RH, extreme VPD |
| SW Kansas | 49 | MODERATE | 9.5% | 12.0% | 7.2 | Red Flag RH |
| W Nebraska | 45 | MODERATE | 11.0% | 16.7% | 4.6 | Red Flag RH |
| **OK Western (burn area)** | **38** | **MODERATE** | **12.9%** | **18.2%** | 4.5 | Red Flag RH |
| S California | 18 | LOW | 16.5% | 35.6% | 2.6 | Moderate VPD only |

**National ranking: Oklahoma's western burn zone scored 38/100 (MODERATE), ranking 7th of 8 regions scanned.** However, this understates surface risk due to column-averaged wind dilution.

**Critical context:**
- NE New Mexico (score 70, ELEVATED) was the worst area nationally — RH as low as 6.4%
- The OK/TX Panhandles (scores 52-56, ELEVATED) were significantly worse than the Woodward area
- SE Wyoming (score 58, ELEVATED) had both low RH and strong winds
- Western Oklahoma was on the lower end of the fire weather spectrum, but still firmly in Red Flag territory (RH below 15%)
- **The burn area was NOT the worst place in the country on Feb 9**, but was still within the broad corridor of concern

## 4. SPC Fire Weather Products — February 9, 2026

### SPC Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook (Valid 09/1200Z - 10/1200Z)
**Issued: 10:31 AM CST Mon Feb 9, 2026** (updated from 1:15 AM issuance)

**CRITICAL areas designated:**
1. **Portions of NE New Mexico into the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles, extreme NW Oklahoma, far SW Kansas**
2. **Portions of far SE Wyoming into far western Nebraska**

**ELEVATED areas:** Broader corridor including Southern High Plains, Central High Plains, southern Colorado foothills

**Key SPC language about the Southern High Plains:**
> "Several hours of widespread elevated and critical fire weather conditions are expected across the Southern High Plains this afternoon. Current guidance is still on track for **strong west-southwesterly winds of 20-25 mph gusting to 40 mph** in some areas and **RH decreasing to 10-15 percent** atop a dry fuelscape."

**Key SPC language about the setup:**
> "Dry downslope flow, in combination with a very deep and dry boundary layer, will support RH dipping into the **10-15 percent range** as sustained west-southwesterly surface winds exceed 20 mph for several hours."
> "The current guidance consensus still depicts the best corridor for Critical conditions over **northeastern New Mexico into the Oklahoma/Texas Panhandles** and immediate surrounding areas."

**SPC Areal Outline Products:**
- CRITICAL polygons covered the OK Panhandle and immediate surrounding area
- ELEVATED polygons extended further south and east, likely encompassing the Woodward area

### SPC Mesoscale Discussions
No active mesoscale discussions retrieved for this period.

### SPC Day 1 Outlook for Feb 10 (next day)
"NO CRITICAL AREAS" — confirming the fire weather event was a one-day affair tied to the Feb 9 pattern.

> "Fire weather conditions continue to improve this evening. A cold front/northerly wind shift will enter northwest Oklahoma around 3 to 4 AM and will move southeast across the entire area Tuesday morning and afternoon. **Gusty northerly winds in excess of 30 mph are likely behind this wind shift. If there are any ongoing firefighting efforts, this wind shift will make these efforts challenging.**"

**This is critically important: NWS explicitly warned that the overnight wind shift would complicate any ongoing fire operations.**

## 6. NWS Norman (OUN) Area Forecast Discussion

**Issued: 12:52 PM CST Mon Feb 9, 2026** (forecaster: Ungar)

### Key Statements:

**On fire weather:**
> "An afternoon and early evening of fire weather danger is upcoming for portions of western Oklahoma and western-north Texas."
> "Warm temperatures and strong diurnal mixing will contribute to very low relative humidity, **possibly as low as 10% in spots**, across far western portions of the area."
> "Amidst **increasingly dry fuels**, problematic fire weather conditions are developing across portions of far western and northwestern Oklahoma."
> "A **Red Flag Warning** continues for portions of the aforementioned area through 7 PM this evening, and **burning is discouraged in and near the warning area.**"

**On the incoming front:**
> "A strong surface front will begin pushing southward across northern Oklahoma during the **predawn hours on Tuesday**. The main sensible change with this feature will be shifting (southwest-to-north) and gusty winds (**up to 40-45 mph possible**)."
> "The front is expected to extend near the Interstate 44 corridor towards daybreak on Tuesday."

**On temperatures:**
> "Widespread peak temperature readings in the 80s are likely, and a few locations across northern and central Oklahoma may approach **daily records for February 9th**."

### Critical Quote for Investigation:
**"burning is discouraged in and near the warning area"** — The Norman WFO explicitly discouraged burning during the Red Flag Warning period.

## 7. Fire Report Checklist for Woodward (36.43, -99.39)

The checklist identifies 10 verification items in priority order:

| Priority | Item | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| CRITICAL | Wind Verification | Must verify model winds vs actual mesonet/ASOS obs |
| CRITICAL | Terrain Accuracy | Must check for canyon/valley features (Canadian River breaks) |
| CRITICAL | Fuel Conditions | Must include seasonal context (freeze-dried winter grass) |
| HIGH | Overnight Conditions | Must distinguish "recovery" from frontal wind shift |
| HIGH | Geographic Focus | Must check all quadrants for terrain hazards |
| HIGH | Ignition Sources | Must mention prescribed burns as #1 ignition source for OK |
| MODERATE | Regional Context | Must compare to historical range for station/month |
| MODERATE | Model vs Observation | Must label model data as model, not surface truth |
| MODERATE | Cold Front Timing | Must prominently highlight the wind shift timing |
| MODERATE | Drought & Seasonal | Must include drought status and winter fuel context |

**Critical warning from checklist:** "Assuming 'flat grassland' everywhere" is a common error. Woodward has Canadian River breaks nearby that create terrain-driven fire behavior.

## 8. Claim Validation Results

All 5 claims require verification against surface observations. Summary assessment:

| Claim | Preliminary Assessment |
|-------|----------------------|
| RH below 15% | **SUPPORTED** — NWS RFW stated RH as low as 11% for Harper/Ellis/Woodward; model shows min 12.9% on E-W transect; SPC forecast 10-15% |
| Winds of 40 mph | **PARTIALLY SUPPORTED** — NWS OUN forecast gusts to 35 mph for Woodward area; NWS AMA forecast gusts to 40 mph for Panhandle; post-frontal gusts to 40-45 mph forecast for overnight. 40 mph gusts in Woodward proper need mesonet verification |
| Terrain: flat | **NEEDS NUANCE** — Western OK is predominantly flat grassland but Canadian River breaks near Woodward create channeling terrain. "Predominantly flat with some breaks" is more accurate |
| Fuels: dormant grass | **SUPPORTED** — February timing = dormant/cured grass; NWS noted "increasingly dry fuels"; SPC ERC 70th-89th percentile; warm spell may have desiccated fuels further |
| Front timing: evening | **NEEDS REVISION** — Front arrival at Woodward was predawn Tuesday (3-4 AM per NWS), not evening. The RFW expired at 7 PM as conditions improved, but the actual frontal passage was ~6 hours later. "Predawn" or "overnight" is more accurate than "evening" |

## 9. Investigation Checklist for Woodward (36.43, -99.39)

The FireRiskAnalyzer recommends the following investigation steps in priority order:

1. **Get METAR observations** from nearest station (KWWR Woodward) — ground truth for T, Td, wind, vis
2. **Get RAWS observations** — fire-specific stations with fuel moisture data
3. **Check NWS alerts/RFW** — forecaster assessment carries more weight than model scores
4. **Check SPC fire outlook** — national-level context
5. **Get elevation profile** — terrain drives fire behavior
6. **Check drought status** — long-term drying amplifies risk
7. **Get cross-section images** — visual vertical structure analysis
8. **Get Street View imagery** — assess actual fuel type and WUI interface
9. **Compare model vs observations** — the most important step; model column-averaged RH may show 45% when surface is 12%

## 10. Analytical Reasoning — Risk Landscape Assessment

### How did risk evolve through the afternoon?

Risk followed the classic diurnal fire weather cycle with a pronounced peak:
- **1 PM (F01):** Risk LOW (14/100). Mixing had not yet fully developed. RH mean 30.3% — still marginal. A prescribed burn ignited at this time would have encountered less aggressive conditions, but the trajectory was clearly toward deterioration.
- **3 PM (F03):** Risk MODERATE (40/100). Peak mixing achieved. RH min dropped to 12.9%, mean fell to 22.9%. This is the heart of the burn period and the worst conditions.
- **5 PM (F05):** Risk declining back to LOW (17/100). Some recovery beginning. But RH mean still 22.8% — not yet safe.
- **8 PM (F08):** Risk LOW (13/100). RH recovering (mean 34.3%). But the approaching cold front meant winds would intensify again overnight.

**Was early afternoon lower?** Yes — F01 risk (14) was less than half of F03 (40). But this is deceptive. A prescribed burn ignited at 1 PM would still be burning at 3 PM when conditions peaked. The NWS Red Flag Warning was in effect from noon through 7 PM precisely because the entire afternoon was dangerous, not just the peak hour.

### In national context, was Oklahoma the worst area?

**No. Oklahoma's western burn area was NOT the worst.** The national comparison shows:
- NE New Mexico scored 70 (ELEVATED) with RH as low as 6.4% — nearly 2x worse
- SE Wyoming scored 58 (ELEVATED) with the strongest winds (16.8 kt max)
- The OK/TX Panhandles scored 52-56 (ELEVATED) — significantly worse than the Woodward area
- The Woodward corridor scored 38 (MODERATE) — on the lower end of the fire weather spectrum

However, "not the worst" does not mean "safe." The Woodward area was:
- Under an active Red Flag Warning
- Within the SPC's ELEVATED fire weather area
- Adjacent to the SPC CRITICAL area
- In a zone where the NWS explicitly said "burning is discouraged"

### What did the SPC/NWS say? Did they explicitly mention prescribed burning?

**SPC:** Did not specifically mention prescribed burns but designated CRITICAL fire weather for the OK/TX Panhandles corridor and ELEVATED for the broader western OK area. Language was clear: "strong west-southwesterly winds of 20-25 mph gusting to 40 mph" with "RH decreasing to 10-15 percent atop a dry fuelscape."

**NWS Norman:** Was the most explicit:
- **"burning is discouraged in and near the warning area"** — direct language in the Area Forecast Discussion
- **"Any fires that develop will likely spread rapidly. Outdoor burning is not recommended."** — standard Red Flag Warning language
- The Fire Weather Watch (issued Feb 8) also stated "Outdoor burning is not recommended"

**Both agencies provided advance warning (Fire Weather Watch issued 24+ hours prior) and explicit warnings against burning.**

### Can a case be made that risk was "elevated but manageable" at any point?

**Theoretically, but it would be a weak case.** Here is what a proponent might argue:

Arguments FOR "manageable" conditions:
- Risk score at F01 (1 PM) was only 14/100 (LOW)
- The Woodward area scored lower than 6 of 7 comparison regions
- Wind gusts forecast at 35 mph (Woodward) vs 40 mph (Panhandle) — slightly less severe
- ERC was 70th-89th percentile (4/5) — not the highest category
- SPC classified the area as ELEVATED, not CRITICAL
- The fire weather event was time-limited (noon-7 PM) with conditions improving by evening

Arguments AGAINST "manageable":
- **A Red Flag Warning was active.** This is the highest fire weather alert level. It is not advisory — it is a warning
- **The NWS explicitly said "burning is discouraged"** — this removes any ambiguity about official guidance
- **Conditions were forecast to worsen dramatically from ignition time** — any burn started at 1 PM would face peak conditions by 3 PM
- **The post-frontal wind shift to 40-45 mph northerly** meant any incomplete burn would face reversed, stronger winds overnight
- **RH as low as 10-11%** (per NWS) is extremely low even by western OK standards
- **Temperatures in the 80s in February** — record-approaching warmth driving extreme boundary layer mixing
- **Dormant/cured grass fuels with above-normal ERC** — the fuelscape was primed

**Bottom line:** The conditions were objectively dangerous. While the burn zone was not in the SPC CRITICAL area and was not the worst area nationally, it was under an active Red Flag Warning with explicit guidance against burning. The "manageable" argument fails primarily because of the official guidance that was in place — there was no ambiguity from forecasters that this was not a day for prescribed fire.

## 11. Summary Risk Matrix

| Factor | Assessment | Rating |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Transect risk score (peak) | 40/100 MODERATE (understated due to wind dilution) | ELEVATED |
| National ranking | 7th of 8 regions (not the worst) | MODERATE |
| SPC classification | ELEVATED (adjacent to CRITICAL) | ELEVATED |
| NWS alert level | RED FLAG WARNING | CRITICAL |
| NWS guidance on burning | "Burning is discouraged" / "Not recommended" | CRITICAL |
| Advance warning | Fire Weather Watch issued 24h prior | ADEQUATE |
| RH conditions | 10-13% (NWS obs/forecast) | CRITICAL |
| Wind conditions | SW 15-25 mph, gusts 35 mph | ELEVATED |
| Fuel conditions | Dormant grass, ERC 70-89th pctl | ELEVATED |
| Post-event complication | Frontal wind shift to N 40-45 mph | CRITICAL |
| Temperature anomaly | 80s in February (near-record) | EXTREME |

**Overall assessment: Conditions were objectively dangerous for prescribed fire. While not the most extreme location nationally, the area was under explicit Red Flag Warnings with unambiguous guidance against burning. The combination of low RH, strong winds, extreme warmth, dry fuels, and an impending frontal wind shift created a setup where prescribed burn escapes were predictable and preventable.**
