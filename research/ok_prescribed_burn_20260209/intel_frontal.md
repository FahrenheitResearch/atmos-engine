# Frontal & Temporal Analysis: Western Oklahoma, February 9, 2026

**Analyst Role**: Frontal & Temporal Analyst
**Cycle**: HRRR 20260209_18z (initialized 12:00 PM CST Feb 9, 2026)
**Sites**: Woodward OK (36.43, -99.39), Gage OK (36.31, -99.76), Elk City OK (35.41, -99.40)
**Purpose**: Determine whether a safe temporal window existed for prescribed burn operations on the morning of February 9, 2026, given Red Flag Warning conditions and an approaching cold front.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**There was no justifiable burn window on February 9, 2026 in western Oklahoma.**

The HRRR model data paints an unambiguous picture: conditions were at or beyond Red Flag Warning criteria from the moment the 18z cycle begins (noon CST), and they deteriorated sharply through the afternoon and evening. The cold front did not arrive until 16+ hours later (approximately 5:00 AM CST on February 10), and even then it brought no meaningful humidity recovery -- only a violent wind reversal with 31-33 kt sustained winds and gusts to 43-46 kt. A morning burn would have faced rapidly intensifying pre-frontal winds with no prospect of humidity recovery until well into the following day.

## 2. Wind Shift Detection Results

### 2.1 Woodward OK (36.43, -99.39)

**Primary Wind Shift Detected:**
- **Timing**: Between FHR 16-17, i.e., 10:00Z-11:00Z Feb 10 (4:00-5:00 AM CST Feb 10)
- **Direction Change**: WSW (258 deg) --> N (355 deg) = 96.6 degree shift
- **Speed Change**: 18.6 kt --> 30.7 kt sustained (INCREASE with frontal passage)
- **Gust Change**: 26 kt --> 43 kt
- **RH Change**: 19.6% --> 32.9%
- **Classification**: MAJOR cold front
- **Type**: Cold front
- **Fire Impact Assessment**: "CRITICAL: Wind shift from WSW to N (97 degrees) will reverse fire spread directions. Pre-shift fires spread ENE; post-shift fires spread S. This is NOT 'nighttime recovery' -- winds remain 31 kt sustained with gusts to 43 kt after the shift. RH increases to 33% -- above critical thresholds but NOT high enough for containment."

### 2.2 Gage OK (36.31, -99.76)

**Two-phase wind shift detected:**

**Phase 1** (FHR 15-16, 09:00-10:00Z Feb 10 = 3:00-4:00 AM CST):
- Direction: SW (221 deg) --> W (278 deg) = 57 degree shift
- Speed: 14.7 --> 14.8 kt (steady)
- Gusts: 21 kt (steady)
- RH: 21.6% --> 18.3% (RH DROPS as front approaches)
- Classification: Moderate cold front

**Phase 2** (FHR 16-17, 10:00-11:00Z Feb 10 = 4:00-5:00 AM CST):
- Direction: W (278 deg) --> N (4 deg) = 86.1 degree shift
- Speed: 14.8 --> 32.8 kt (MORE THAN DOUBLED)
- Gusts: 21 --> 46 kt (MORE THAN DOUBLED)
- RH: 18.3% --> 38.1%
- Classification: Moderate outflow
- Fire Impact: "This is NOT 'nighttime recovery' -- winds remain 33 kt sustained with gusts to 46 kt after the shift."

### 2.3 Elk City OK (35.41, -99.40)

**Primary Wind Shift Detected:**
- **Timing**: FHR 17-18, 11:00-12:00Z Feb 10 (5:00-6:00 AM CST Feb 10) -- front arrives ~1 hour later here
- Direction: W (269 deg) --> NW (322.5 deg) = 53.5 degree shift
- Speed: 30.9 --> 31.0 kt (NO CHANGE -- already at peak)
- Gusts: 43 kt (steady)
- RH: 17.9% --> 15.9% (RH DROPS at frontal passage)
- Classification: Moderate cold front
- **Fire Impact**: "Winds remain 31 kt sustained with gusts to 43 kt after the shift. RH remains critically low at 16% -- fires will continue to spread in the new direction."

**Key finding for Elk City**: The front brings ZERO humidity relief. RH actually decreases. Winds stay at 31 kt. This is a dry frontal passage with no fire suppression value whatsoever.

---

## 3. Overnight Classification Results

| Site | Classification | Overnight RH Range | Overnight Wind Range | Assessment |
|------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------|
| **Woodward** | **frontal_shift** | 17-53% | 16-31 kt | NOT nighttime recovery. Frontal passage at ~11:00Z shifts winds. Winds 16-31 kt overnight. All firelines change direction. |
| **Gage** | **partial_recovery** | 12-53% | 15-33 kt | RH improves to 53% (marginal) but winds remain 15+ kt. Fires moderate but don't go out. Flare-ups expected. |
| **Elk City** | **no_recovery** | 16-24% | 30-34 kt | NO recovery. Winds persist 30+ kt. RH stays below 24%. Fires continue to run overnight. |

### Recovery Classification Definitions (for reference):
- **true_recovery**: Winds < 10 kt AND RH > 50% -- fires lay down, hand crews can work
- **partial_recovery**: RH rises but winds remain gusty -- fires moderate but don't go out
- **frontal_shift**: Cold front passes -- wind reversal, speed may drop but gusts continue. NOT recovery.
- **no_recovery**: Low-level jet or persistent gradient keeps winds up, RH stays low -- fires continue to run

**None of the three sites achieved true recovery.**

## 4. Fire Impact Analysis

### 4.1 Woodward OK -- Tactical Window

- **Current spread direction**: Fire spreading NNE driven by SSW winds at 16.9 kt
- **Post-shift spread direction**: Fire spreading S driven by N winds at 30.7 kt
- **Critical reversal**: 157-degree change in fire spread direction
- **Tactical window**: "16 hours until wind shift -- all operations on the SSW flank must be completed or secured before 2026-02-10T11:00Z."
- **Impact statement**: "CRITICAL REVERSAL: Current SSW flank (rear/heel) may become active or even the new headfire."

### 4.2 Post-Frontal Conditions at Woodward

| Parameter | Value | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Wind direction | N (355 deg) | Complete reversal |
| Sustained wind | 30.7 kt (35 mph) | Operationally significant |
| Wind gusts | 43 kt (49 mph) | Extreme |
| RH | 32.9% | Above 25% critical threshold but well below 50% recovery |

**Assessment**: "Winds decrease but remain operationally significant at 31 kt sustained. RH improves to 33% but below recovery threshold. Post-frontal conditions still support fire spread in the new direction."

### 4.3 Gage OK -- Post-Frontal Conditions

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Wind direction | N (4 deg) |
| Sustained wind | 32.8 kt (38 mph) |
| Wind gusts | 46 kt (53 mph) |
| RH | 38.1% |

**Gage sees the worst post-frontal winds of any site -- 46 kt gusts.** Even with RH at 38%, these winds would sustain fire spread on any cured grassland.

2 PM:  14.0%   |███
3 PM:  13.5%   |███
5 PM:  12.7%   |███    <-- MINIMUM (5 PM, deepest mixing)
7 PM:  16.6%   |████
8 PM:  18.2%   |████
9 PM:  19.8%   |████
10 PM: 21.6%   |█████

### Gage RH Through the Period:
```
1 PM:  17.2%
2 PM:  13.8%
3 PM:  12.3%
5 PM:  10.3%   <-- MINIMUM (even worse than Woodward)
7 PM:  12.3%
8 PM:  13.7%
10 PM: 20.4%
3 AM:  21.6%
4 AM:  18.3%   <-- RH DROPS pre-frontal
5 AM:  38.1%   <-- Front arrives
6 AM:  53.2%
```

### Elk City RH: NEVER exceeds 24% in the entire 18-hour period. No recovery at all.

## 8. Critical Threshold Analysis

### Standard Prescribed Burn Criteria (NWS / NWCG):

| Parameter | Acceptable Range | Conditions at Woodward 1 PM | Conditions at Woodward 5 PM |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| RH | >30% (ideally 40-60%) | **16.7% -- VIOLATED** | **12.7% -- EXTREME VIOLATION** |
| Wind speed | <15 kt sustained | **16.9 kt -- VIOLATED** | **24.6 kt -- EXTREME VIOLATION** |
| Wind gusts | <25 kt | 24 kt -- MARGINAL | **34 kt -- EXTREME VIOLATION** |

## 9. Was There a Morning Burn Window?

### The "Morning Window" Argument

The theoretical defense of a prescribed burn on this day would argue: "We could burn in the early to mid-morning (before peak heating), knowing the cold front would bring humidity recovery by evening, limiting fire spread duration."

### Why This Argument Fails

**Problem 1: The front does not arrive for 16+ hours.** A morning burn (say, 9-11 AM CST) would face conditions that deteriorate sharply all afternoon and evening. The front does not pass Woodward until 5:00 AM CST on February 10 -- that is at least 18 hours after any plausible ignition. During those 18 hours, winds ramp from 17 kt to 30+ kt.

**Problem 2: The front does NOT bring recovery.** Post-frontal winds at Woodward are 30.7 kt sustained, gusting to 43 kt, from the north. RH only reaches 33%. This is NOT fire-suppressing weather. It is a wind direction reversal that would cause any active fire to change spread direction violently -- potentially creating a new headfire from what had been the rear flank.

**Problem 3: "Nighttime recovery" does not occur.** All three sites were classified as either "frontal_shift," "partial_recovery," or "no_recovery." RH at Woodward never exceeds 22% between noon Feb 9 and 5 AM Feb 10. Winds never drop below 17 kt. The HRRR explicitly shows a low-level jet / strong pressure gradient maintaining 28-31 kt winds through the entire overnight period.

**Problem 4: Even the 18z initialization is already marginal.** At 1:00 PM CST (the first valid forecast hour), Woodward already shows RH 16.7% and winds 16.9 kt -- already at or beyond prescribed burn thresholds. Any burns ignited in the morning (before this cycle's initialization) would have been burning into these conditions.

**Problem 5: Conditions are WORSE at Gage.** Gage, 25 miles west, shows even lower RH (10.3% minimum) and faster initial winds (22+ kt by 1 PM). There is no spatial refuge in this area.

**Problem 6: Elk City faces the worst conditions.** At the southernmost site, RH never exceeds 24%, winds reach 32+ kt by evening, and the front brings NO humidity relief at all (RH drops to 16% post-frontal).

### The Only Conceivable Window

The ONLY hour in the entire dataset where conditions approach marginal acceptability is **6:00 AM CST on February 10** (FHR 18), when Woodward shows RH 52.6% and winds 16.5 kt (gusting 23). But this is:
1. After the front has already passed
2. A single hour -- winds were 30.7 kt just one hour before
3. On the FOLLOWING day, not the date in question
4. Still with gusts at 23 kt

This is not a burn window. It is a momentary lull in a violent frontal passage.

```
Feb 9, 2026 (All times CST)
  ~9-11 AM:   Hypothetical morning burn window (conditions unknown from 18z cycle,
              but pre-frontal mixing already underway)
  12:00 PM:   HRRR 18z initialization. Already RH 16-17%, winds 17 kt.

  2:00 PM:    RH 14.0%, wind 18 kt SSW. RED FLAG CONDITIONS MET.
  3:00 PM:    RH 13.5%, wind 19 kt SSW. Peak heating. RH at critical low.
  5:00 PM:    RH 12.7%, wind 25 kt SSW. WINDS RAMPING SHARPLY. G34 kt.
  7:00 PM:    RH 16.6%, wind 28 kt SSW. G39 kt. LLJ coupling begins.
  8:00 PM:    RH 18.2%, wind 29 kt. G40 kt.
  10:00 PM:   RH 21.6%, wind 31 kt. G43 kt. PEAK pre-frontal winds.

Feb 10, 2026
  2:00 AM:    RH 19.3%, wind 27 kt. G38 kt. Still no recovery.
  3:00 AM:    Wind begins veering SW->WSW. Front approaching.
  4:00 AM:    Wind 19 kt WSW (258 deg). Pre-frontal lull. RH still 19.6%.
  5:00 AM:    *** COLD FRONT *** Wind snaps to N 31 kt, G43 kt. RH jumps to 33%.
              CRITICAL wind reversal. 97 degree direction change in 1 hour.
  6:00 AM:    Post-frontal: N 17 kt, G23 kt. RH 53%. Brief quasi-recovery.
              But this is a single data point in a violent transition.
```

## 11. Assessment: Does the Frontal Passage Support or Undermine the Burn Decision?

### THE FRONTAL PASSAGE STRONGLY UNDERMINES ANY JUSTIFICATION FOR BURNING.

1. **The front arrives too late.** 16-18 hours after any plausible morning burn. This is not a "front will knock it down this evening" scenario. It is a "front arrives tomorrow before dawn" scenario.

2. **Pre-frontal conditions are extreme.** The period between ignition and frontal passage includes sustained winds of 28-31 kt with gusts to 43 kt. This is not a "slightly elevated wind" day. These are damaging wind speeds that would drive extreme fire behavior in cured grassland.

3. **The front does not suppress fire.** Post-frontal winds are 31-33 kt with gusts to 43-46 kt. RH improves to only 33-38% at Woodward/Gage and actually DROPS at Elk City. Post-frontal conditions still support aggressive fire spread -- just in a new direction.

4. **The wind reversal creates a new headfire hazard.** Any fire burning NNE pre-frontally would suddenly be driven southward by 31 kt northerly winds. Flanks become heads. Containment lines positioned for a SSW-driven fire are invalidated.

5. **No true overnight recovery occurs at any site.** The classification system designed specifically for fire weather assessment identifies NO site with conditions safe for crew operations. Elk City is classified "no_recovery" -- winds 30+ kt and RH below 24% all night.

6. **Gage, the most exposed western site, sees the lowest RH of all three locations** -- 10.3% at 5 PM. This is extraordinary for any season and utterly disqualifying for burn operations.

### Bottom Line

Anyone forecasting conditions for February 9, 2026 in western Oklahoma -- whether using the morning's model runs, the NWS Red Flag Warning, or even just reading the synoptic setup -- would have identified this as one of the most dangerous fire weather days possible. The approaching cold front was not a source of relief; it was a source of additional hazard (wind reversal, post-frontal gusts). The argument that "the front would bring conditions back under control" is directly contradicted by the HRRR data, which shows the front maintaining or intensifying winds while providing inadequate humidity recovery.
